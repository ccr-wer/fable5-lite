"""PreToolUse guard (Agent|Task|Workflow|TaskCreate): keep multi-phase work on the ledger.

Dynamic Workflow Rule 1: serious multi-phase delegation requires
a Requirements Ledger in .workflow/ — any LEDGER*.md there, most
recent wins, *-archive.md excluded (searched from the working
directory up to the repo root or $HOME). Short spawn
prompts (quick searches/lookups) pass freely so casual Explore
agents are never blocked.

What is gated:
    Agent / Task  -> length of tool_input.prompt
    Workflow      -> length of tool_input.script (an orchestration
                     script IS the delegation plan; name/scriptPath
                     resume calls carry no new plan text and pass)
    TaskCreate    -> the SOLO path the spawn gates can't see: a chair
                     that never delegates never trips them, but the
                     tracker tasks it creates for itself are the tell.
                     The Nth TaskCreate of a session (default 3rd)
                     with no ledger draws ONE deny — "multi-phase
                     work: write the ledger, delegate to workers" —
                     then stays quiet (measured in the wild: a
                     6-phase plan implemented entirely on the chair).
Exempt:
    fork subagents (subagent_type == "fork") — a fork inherits the
    full conversation context, so the ledger is already in front
    of it; forcing a file adds nothing.

The threshold defaults to 1500 chars — strict on purpose. This
plugin is built for a Claude Fable 5 chair, where even small
delegations should carry a ledger: Fable tokens are the scarce
resource, and detail loss at task->plan translation is exactly
what the ledger exists to catch.

Staleness: a ledger satisfies the gates unless it is STALE-COMPLETE —
every item closed AND untouched since before this session started
(session start read from the injector's marker). Without that rule,
last week's finished ledger would silence the gates in a repo forever.
A ledger with open items, or one touched this session, always
satisfies; without a marker (manual install) existence alone wins.

Configuration (all optional):
    LEDGER_GUARD_THRESHOLD   gate in chars (default 1500; unparseable
                             values fall back to it, negatives clamp
                             to 0)
    LEDGER_GUARD_TASKS       deny fires AT the Nth ledgerless tracker
                             task (default 3 — two tasks pass free;
                             0 or negative disables the task gate)
    FABLE_ORCH_METRICS=0     disables the local metrics log
